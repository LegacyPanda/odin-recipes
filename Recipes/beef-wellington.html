        <p>Beef Wellington is a dish that consists of a cut of beef that is coated in paté, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked until 
            the pastry is a beautiful golden brown. The classic English dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.</p>

            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 ounces liver paté</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                Prehead the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Step 2
                Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread tablespoons softened butter over beef.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3
                Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool 
                completely.
            </li>
            <li>Step 4
                Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Step 5
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and 
                let cool.
            </li>
            <li>Step 6
                Mix pate and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread pate mixture over 
                beef. Top with onion an mushroom mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Step 7
                Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.
            </li>
            <li>Step 8
                Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9*13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits
                in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.
            </li>
            <li>Step 9 
                Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich,
                golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F 
                (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.
            </li>
            <li>Step 10
                Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly
                reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.
            </li>
            <li>Step 11
                Serve hot and enjoy.
            </li>
        </ol>
